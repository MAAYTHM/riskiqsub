## Whats use of this tool?
To get subdomains from 'https://community.riskiq.com'. As there is no api endpoint, it uses valid credentials to login and then get subdomains.

## Why riskiqsub?
Actually I found [RiskIQ](https://community.riskiq.com) a fair source of getting subdomains and it is not included in [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) enum list (I think because of `no api support` for riskiq's subdomains functionality). Thats how this tool idea came.

## Requirement?
* python 3.x

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAAYTHM/riskiqsub.git
cd riskiqsub
```
* EITHER
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* OR
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
